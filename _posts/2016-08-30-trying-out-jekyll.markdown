I've tried to create a blog a few times, but I just didn't like the things I've tried so far. That is, Wordpress and Blogspot (for a math and art-related blog, respectively).

I've considered using some minimal framework like [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), but given the hype that there is around static site generators, I said "Why not?". After all, I don't think I'll need some database-hungry app inside the site (at least for now).

Other than that, I *love* the idea of working with text files. That way, I don't have to deviate from my regular working environment, so transitioning between programming and blogging is seamless. You can use vim, Atom, VS Code, emacs, etc. You work with the environment of your choice, not limited by the in-browser editor of blogging platforms. Now, that brings me to...

Why Jekyll?

Actually there's no good reason other than it's the obvious choice. Since Github offers so much [integration with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/), chances are I won't have to fight against the system with hacks and stuff. Of course, Jekyll is not the most flexible thing ever, but by the time I need special functionality, I guess it's time to evaluate other options. Meanwhile, Jekyll is just right.

There are other static site generators that look very nice, like [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) or [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) (which works with Python!). Actually, there are a lot of them, and selecting one is very hard. This is the typical [Overchoice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overchoice) scenario, isn't it? Actually the same scenario is present in many other areas of web development, but that's a topic for another post.

My initial toolchain
---
I'm starting off using Atom with the [Jekyll package](https://atom.io/packages/jekyll) installed. Usually I use vim, but I'm yet to research plugins for easier workflow, and if it's actually worth it (Also, I have to solve some color problems I have with Markdown). For now, Atom comes with almost everything out of the box, and I really like the Markdown preview feature. I also love the fact that it's in the official Arch Linux repositories, so installing it was as easy as `sudo pacman -S atom` (VS Code is in the AUR). For the rest I'm just using the terminal.

So what are you gonna write about?
---
I have some ideas, but there's a thing: It's a common thing for me to be learning something and say something like "Man, I wish I had a site to write about this". Like a learning journal. Some math proofs might as well go into this: I'm a math major and being able to see past proofs is nice.

I'm a very slow reader, but one of my goals is to finish reading Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, so it's possible I'll write about that sometimes.

Let's just hope this is not one of those dead blogs I've made in the past =)
