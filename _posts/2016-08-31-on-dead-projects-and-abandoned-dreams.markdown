Starting this blog made me remember the countless amount of projects I've left before.

And that's not only me: Entire group projects that died after a week, a month, a year. Surely there's a trend there. Let me tell you a story.

You receive this Facebook message: "Hey I have this cool idea, let's start a book club!". Everybody goes "Alright!". Big plans, great organization. You're only around 10 people but it's OK, "We're just starting out".

In this book club, you have deep intellectual discussions. Suddenly you feel this thing will change your life, I mean, all this adrenaline can't be lying, right? Everybody seems as excited as you. There's a calendar with the meetings, the places for reunion are already reserved, damn there are plans for making a website! We're going to get published in the college newspaper, obviously! And the group will grow and be important! This is so going into my CV.

So the first few meetings go wonderful. The second and third meetings include new people, so this thing is growing! But then someone says: *I can't go tomorrow, I have this problem*.

You know, from past experience this is really bad for a starting project. **The first time you fail to do something, you set a big precedent**, and suddenly it becomes common. More and more people fail to show up for undisclosed reasons. Then the amount of people you had initially seems like a dream... If only you could go back to simpler times.

## Seems familiar?

The problem with us, human beings, is that we don't foresee the implications of starting something. Why would people fail to show up? Maybe the novelty wore off after a while, or they weren't so interested in talking about German philosophy on Friday nights. But let's talk about this trend in general, so let's not point out about the specific reasons.

The rush feeling we get when starting out something new is amazing, but also dangerous. There are a lot of people who get working on new ideas just to kill them after a while. Or worse, not kill them and say they're going to complete it later (This can get very annoying when the projects we're talking about are actual physical things like paintings).

It's very sad. Dead open source projects on Github, dead blogs on Blogspot that were once very active. Abandoned MOOC's in Coursera (did you know [the completion rate is below 7%?](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/mooc-completion-rates-below-7/2003710.article)), people not going to the gym after some months, abandoned diets, books left on the table.

Remember: They all started with someone *excited* with their new endeavor.

## What to do?

I'm not into self-help stuff, and there's a lot of people throwing motivational writings for you to feel better (There's an [entire topic on Quora](https://www.quora.com/topic/Setting-Goals)). Hey, maybe they'll help.

The harsh truth is that sometimes it's not under your control. The guys who failed to show up in our story? Maybe some of them actually had legitimate reasons. Others were just lazy. It doesn't matter: You can't control them. Sure, you *could* give them more reasons to go, maybe trying a trendy topic to talk about, I don't know. But would it be worth it?

When I remember my abandoned dreams, I like to think that they're gone for good, it was a nice learning experience, and life intended this to happen so that I find new open doors that wouldn't be at my reach otherwise. I'm not a religious person, but thinking that at least gives me certain peace of mind.

## My plan

Like most people, I have these project I really don't want to abandon. For example, I don't want this blog to die and be a statistic with the [95% of blogs that are not anymore](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/fashion/07blogs.html?_r=0).

I want to finish learning Haskell, functional analysis, differential geometry. I want to finish two website ideas I had for a while, study for qualifiers, learn more about Angular 2. All while keeping up with college.

Hopefully you'll see the progress here.

## Things to do now

Even though this blog is personal and new, I want to add Disqus comments already. I would also like to see how to implement Katex with Jekyll (It seems like Github Pages won't let me use a [cute little plugin I found](https://github.com/drewsberry/jekyll-katex-block), so the most obvious approach right now is compiling the whole site locally).

I think I'll be writing more about the topic of this post sooner or later. It's just something that bothers me a lot. For now, until the next time.
