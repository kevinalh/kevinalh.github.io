Math major, programmer wannabe, eternal learner.

The (maybe temporal) title of this blog is inspired by the [Axiom of Countable Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_countable_choice).

This is still a very new blog so writing a larger About page doesn't feel right yet. You can enter my Twitter and Github accounts below. Have a nice day!
